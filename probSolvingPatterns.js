George Polya - How to solve it ---Book

Master common problem solving patterns

1. Understand The Problem
    - Can you restate the problem in my own words.
    - What are the inputs that go into the problem.
    - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problems.
    - How should i label the important parts.

2. Explore Concrete Examples
    - Start with Simple examples
    - Progress to more complex emamples
    - Explores examples with empty inputs.
    - Explores examples with invalid inputs.

3. Break it down
    - Write it out steps you need to takes.
    - Forces you to think about your code.

 function charCount(str) {
     // make object to return at end
     // loop over string for each char 
        // if the char is a number/char there add one to count
        // if char is not in object, add it and set vaule to 1
        // if char is something else, dont do anything
     //return object
 }
4. Solve/Simply
    - Find the core diffculty in what oyure trying to do.
    - Temp ignore the difficlty
    - Write a smple solution
    - Then incorpoate that difficulty in the problem

5. Look Back and Refactor
    -Faster?
    -Cleaner?
    -Improve performance
    - Other ways of doing it

// Write a function which takes a string and returns counnts of each character
